      "Real Madrid Club de Fútbol is a professional football club based in
      Madrid, Spain.The club was formed in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, and
      played its first competitive match on 13 May 1902, when it lost 3–1 in the
      semi-final of the Campeonato de Copa de S.M. Alfonso XIII against FC
      Barcelona.[1] Real Madrid played against other local clubs in various
      regional tournaments, that served as qualifiers for the Copa del Rey, from
      1902 to 1940. In 1929, the club became one of the founding members of La
      Liga, Spain's first national league. As of 2024, Real is one of only three
      clubs never to have been relegated from the top level of Spanish football,
      the others being Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona.[2][3] From 1902 to 1929,
      Real won the Copa del Rey five times and the regional championship 15
      times. Real Madrid had a successful start in La Liga, finishing second in
      the competition's first season, and winning the league in 1932 for the
      first time. In the 1947–48 season, Madrid finished eleventh, which
      remains, as of 2022, the club's lowest final position.[4] Real Madrid won
      La Liga four times and the European Cup five times during the 1950s.
      However, the most successful period for the club in terms of domestic
      titles was the 1960s, when Real Madrid won eight league championships. It
      won its first double of league championship and national cup in 1962. Real
      is also the only Spanish football team to win five consecutive titles, a
      feat which it has achieved on two occasions (1960–65 and 1985–90).[5] In
      addition to their domestic success, Real Madrid's reputation as a major
      club was established by their outstanding record in the European Cup. To
      date, they have been crowned champions of Europe a record fifteen times.
      Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás and other famous players helped the club
      win the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which
      included a memorable 7–3 Hampden Park final against German side Eintracht
      Frankfurt in 1960. The club won the trophy for a sixth time in 1966 with a
      team known as the Ye-Ye that defeated Yugoslavian club Partizan 2–1 in the
      final while being composed entirely of Spanish-born players, a first in
      the competition. They were also runners-up in 1962, 1964 and 1981. Winning
      the competition five consecutive times saw Real permanently awarded the
      original cup and earning the right to wear a multiple-winner badge since
      2000. They have also won the UEFA Cup twice and were twice runners-up in
      the European Cup Winners' Cup. In 1996, president Lorenzo Sanz appointed
      Fabio Capello as coach. Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real
      Madrid were proclaimed league champions and several important players
      arrived at the club, such as Roberto Carlos, Predrag Mijatović, Davor
      Šuker and Clarence Seedorf, to strengthen a squad that already boasted the
      likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real
      Madrid, with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997, finally ended its
      32-year wait for the seventh European Cup in 1998 under manager Jupp
      Heynckes, defeating Juventus 1–0 in the final thanks to a goal from
      Mijatović. Real Madrid would go on to win again in 2000, 2002 (under
      manager Vicente del Bosque), 2014 (under manager Carlo Ancelotti), 2016,
      2017, 2018 (under manager Zinedine Zidane), 2022 and 2024 (again under
      Ancelotti). Madrid are also eight-time winners of the Intercontinental
      Cup/FIFA Club World Cup, defeating Peñarol, Vasco da Gama, Club Olimpia,
      San Lorenzo, Kashima Antlers, Grêmio, Al Ain and Al Hilal in 1960, 1998,
      2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2022 respectively. Early years Madrid FC
      team in 1906. The club won its second Copa del Rey that year. Real
      Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the
      academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza.[6] They
      founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in December 1897, commonly known as La
      Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only club based in Madrid, playing on
      Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some
      of them to leave and create a new club, called Nueva Sociedad de Foot-ball
      (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football.
      Nueva Sociedad was founded in October 1900 in a tavern on Calle de la
      Cruz. The dissenters were led by Julián Palacios, recognized as the first
      Real Madrid president.[7] The other dissenters included brothers and
      future presidents of Real Madrid, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, as well
      as Adolfo Meléndez, Antonio Neyra, Manolo Mendía, Varela, and the Giralt
      brothers (Armando, José and Mario). In October 1901, Nueva Sociedad de
      Foot-ball was renamed as Madrid Football Club.[7][8][9] The first field
      the club used to play matches was a camp in Moncloa, located on the
      current Vallehermoso street. They utilised the El Solar de Estrada in
      1901, which was owned by Claudio Estrada, a member of the club and the
      father-in-law of president Julián Palacios. The club later played matches
      at the Tiro del Pichón between 1901 and 1902.[10] On 6 March 1902, after a
      new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club
      was officially founded.[6] The Padrós brothers summoned other football
      enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family's
      fashion business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be
      accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new
      club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid
      Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also
      set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be
      white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had
      met on one of his trips.[11][12] The club had 28 founding socios
      (members).[13] The club played its first ever match on 9 March 1902. It
      featured two teams of Madrid FC players and was played between the streets
      of Alcalá and Goya, next to the old Plaza de Toros. The two teams wore
      blue and red respectively, with the blue team winning the match 1–0.[14]
      Madrid paid an annual rent of 150 pesetas for the pitch, and the players
      changed into their playing kits in a tavern called La Taurina.[6] The
      regulations governing the club, comprising 22 articles, were drafted on 18
      April and approved by provincial governor José Sanchez Guerra on 22 April
      1902.[6] Madrid FC played its first match against another club on 2 May
      1902 at the Hipódromo in a friendly against New Foot-Ball Club that ended
      in a 1–1 draw.[15] Carlos Padrós, wanting to demonstrate that the club
      could organize matches against other teams, helped organize the 1902 Copa
      de la Coronación in honour of the coronation of Alfonso XIII. He convinced
      the mayor of Madrid, Alberto Aguilera, to donate a silver cup as the prize
      for the winning team. Padrós contacted the captains of FC Barcelona, Club
      Español de Foot-Ball, Bizcaya (a combination of Athletic Club and Bilbao
      Football Club) and New Foot-Ball Club and invited them to enter the
      competition. The event was the first national football tournament played
      in Spain and was held at the Hipódromo. Madrid FC contested its first
      competitive match in the semi-finals of the Copa de la Coronación on 13
      May.[11][6] Arthur Johnson scored the club's first competitive goal in a
      1–3 loss to FC Barcelona. This was also the first El Clásico.[16] Madrid
      secured its first competitive victory defeating Club Español de Football
      (now RCD Espanyol) 3–2 on 16 May 1902.[17] On 23 May 1902, Alfonso Albéniz
      became the first player to leave FC Barcelona in order to join Madrid.[6]
      Madrid was invited to participate in festivities at El Escorial in August
      1902, part of which included a match against Moncloa. The match was played
      next to the facade of the monastery on 11 August and ended with a 6–5
      score favourable to Madrid. The club was awarded two ceramic plates which
      represent the first trophy in its history.[6] Carlos Padrós initiated the
      establishment of the Madrid Association of Foot-ball Clubs, a football
      association responsible for the administration of the sport in Madrid, in
      December 1902. He also became the association's first president. The
      Association organized the 1903 Campeonato de Madrid, the inaugural edition
      of the regional championship of Madrid.[note 1] Padrós resigned as
      president of the association in December 1903, and it dissolved in March
      1904.[18][19] Madrid played their first match outside of the Community of
      Madrid against Club Español de Fútbol at the Parc de la Ciutadella in
      Barcelona on 24 February 1903.[15] The club participated in the inaugural
      edition of the Copa del Rey held at the Hipódromo in 1903. Madrid defeated
      RCD Espanyol 4–1 in the competition's first match on 6 April 1903.[20] The
      club finished runners-up after losing 3–2 in the final to Athletic Bilbao.
      The match was also the first El Viejo Clásico.[15] The club faced a major
      crisis during the 1903–04 season. A dispute between the members in October
      1903 resulted in several players leaving the club to form Club Español de
      Madrid. They included Antonio Neyra, Enrique Aruabarrena, Pérez, Manuel
      Vallarino, Ramón Cárdenas, and brothers Mario, Armando and José Giralt.
      Five other Madrid players also left the club to join Moncloa.[21][11] This
      precipitated a merger with Moderno on 30 January 1904. Carlos Padrós was
      elected president post-merger.[22] The club officially adopted the name
      Madrid–Moderno due to the merger, although most members, players and fans
      generally continued to refer to it as Madrid. The club dropped the Moderno
      name before the next season.[23] Madrid retroactively secured the 1903
      Campeonato de Madrid trophy, won by Moderno, as a result of their
      merger.[24] The club won the first Madrid derby defeating Atlético Madrid
      6–0 on 13 November 1904 in a friendly at the Plaza de Toros.[25] Madrid
      was a founding member of the Fédération Internationale de Football
      Association (FIFA) on 21 May 1904.[6]
