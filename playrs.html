          and goals, correct as of 21:37, 9 July 2024 (UTC) Kylian Mbappé Lottin
          (born 20 December 1998) is a French professional footballer who plays
          as a forward for La Liga club Real Madrid and captains the France
          national team.[2] Widely regarded as one of the best players in the
          world, he is known for his dribbling, speed, and finishing.[3][4][5]
          Born in Paris and raised in nearby Bondy, Mbappé began his senior club
          career in 2015 with Monaco, where he won the Ligue 1 title in the
          2016–17 season. In 2017, aged 18, Mbappé signed for Paris
          Saint-Germain on an eventual permanent transfer worth €180 million,
          making him the second-most-expensive player and most expensive teenage
          player of all time.[6] With PSG, he won six Ligue 1 titles and four
          Coupes de France, including a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20
          season, while also leading the club to its first ever UEFA Champions
          League final in 2020. He is the club's all-time top goalscorer, ranks
          third in assists, and is the seventh-highest goalscorer in Ligue 1
          history. In 2024, Mbappé joined Real Madrid on a free transfer.

          Jude Victor William Bellingham (born 29 June 2003) is an English
          professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for La Liga club
          Real Madrid and the England national team. He is considered one of the
          best players in the world.[7] Bellingham joined Birmingham City as an
          under-8, became the club's youngest first-team player when he made his
          senior debut in August 2019, at the age of 16 years, 38 days, and
          played regularly during the 2019–20 season. He joined Borussia
          Dortmund in July 2020, and in his first appearance became their
          youngest goalscorer. Over three seasons with the club he made 132
          appearances and won the 2020–21 DFB-Pokal; his performances in the
          2022–23 season helped Dortmund finish as runners-up and earned him the
          Bundesliga Player of the Season award. Later that year he won both
          major awards for male footballers aged under 21: the Golden Boy, for
          nominees playing in Europe over the last calendar year,[8] and the
          Kopa Trophy, for the world's best over the previous season.[9][10]
          Bellingham then signed for Real Madrid for a fee of €103 million, and
          in his first season, was the club's top league scorer, helped them win
          the league title and the Champions League, and was voted La Liga
          Player of the Season.[11]
